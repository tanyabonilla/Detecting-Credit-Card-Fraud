# Detecting-Credit-Card-Fraud

In this project, we will be using machine learning algorithms to be able to distinguish between fraudulant and non-fraudulant credit card trasnactions. This project will compare a set of 3 algorithms to see how the results differentiate between.

**Algorithms:**
1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Trees
3. Logistic Regression
